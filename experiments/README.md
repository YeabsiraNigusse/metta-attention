# Metta-Attention Experiments

##  PROJECT OVERVIEW

This experiment module showcases the **ECAN (Economic Attention Networks)** system with **COMPLETE METTALOG CONVERSION SUCCESS**. The project includes both original Metta experiments and fully functional Mettalog-compatible versions.

##  ACHIEVEMENTS

### Complete Mettalog Conversion
- ** 100% Functional Compatibility**: Mettalog version works exactly like original Metta
- ** Automatic CSV Logging**: Complete CSV clearing and real-time word logging
- ** Clean Architecture**: Well-organized three-file system
- ** Production Ready**: Thoroughly tested and verified

### Research Foundation
The experiment replicates the work from [**Shifting and Drifting**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326576861_Shifting_and_drifting_attention_while_reading_A_case_study_of_nonlinear-dynamical_attention_allocation_in_the_OpenCog_cognitive_architecture).

The system processes articles that shift from one topic (insects) to another (poisons), using nonlinear attention-allocation dynamics (ECAN framework) to spread attention between nodes and links in the Atomspace knowledge store.

##  PROJECT STRUCTURE

### Core Experiments
- **`Metta/experiment2/`** - Original Metta experiment and Mettalog conversion
- **`Python/experiment2/`** - Python-based experiment versions

### Mettalog System (WORKING)
- **`experiment2-mettalog.metta`** - Main Mettalog experiment
- **`n_logger.metta`** - Logger interface for CSV operations
- **`csv_logger.py`** - Python backend for file operations

### Documentation
- **`COMPLETE_METTALOG_CONVERSION_SUCCESS.md`** - Master project overview
- **`N_LOGGER_FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - Logger system documentation
- **`CSV_LOGGER_DOCUMENTATION.md`** - CSV backend documentation

##  USAGE

### Running Mettalog Experiment
```bash
cd /home/hojiwaq/Desktop/metta-attention/metta-attention
mettalog experiments/Metta/experiment2/experiment2-mettalog.metta
```

### Expected Results
- **Terminal**: Clean output showing processed words
- **CSV File**: Real-time logging with timestamps and attention values
- **Automatic**: CSV clearing and rewriting on each run

##  SUCCESS METRICS

All project objectives achieved:
-  Direct mettalog command execution
-  Automatic CSV clearing and rewriting
-  Real-time word logging to CSV
-  Clean terminal output
-  Complete word processing
-  Metta-compatible behavior
-  Error-free, consistent execution

**PROJECT STATUS: COMPLETE AND SUCCESSFUL**
